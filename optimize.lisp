;;;; Compiler optimization settings.

(in-package #:com.google.base)

;;; To recompile code with different compiler optimization settings, rebind
;;; these special variables.

(defparameter *optimize-default*
  '(optimize (compilation-speed 0) (debug 3) (safety 3) (space 1) (speed 1))
  "Compiler optimization settings that emphasize debugging over speed.  Most code should use these
settings.")

(defparameter *optimize-fast-unsafe*
  ;; Use the default debugging level.
  '(optimize (compilation-speed 0) (debug 2) (safety 0) (space 1) (speed 3))
  "Compiler optimization settings that emphasize speed at the expense of debugging and run-time
safety.  Only low-level performance sensitive code that has been extensively tested should use
these settings.")
